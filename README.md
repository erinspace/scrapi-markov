SHARE Markov Description Generator and Tweeter
=============

Generate random bits of science text from descriptions in the SHARE notification service! 

This little thing goes to the beta SHARE API endpoint located at: 
https://share-dev.osf.io/api/v1/app/6qajn/

Then, gathers some descriptions...

And spits out a line of text!
